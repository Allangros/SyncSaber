# Mod Info
This mod automatically downloads songs from your favorite mappers whenever you launch Beat Saber. Additionally, this mod is also capable of automatically downloading your followings feed and bookmarks feed from BeastSaber (https://bsaber.com)! If you're lazy like me, this mod is probably for you!

# Getting Started
Create a file called FavoriteMappers.ini in the UserData folder inside your beat saber directory (this file will be created for you automatically when you launch the game, so don't worry if you skipped this step!)

Next, all you have to do is enter your favorite mappers BeatSaver usernames (one mapper per line) in FavoriteMappers.ini.

That's it! Everytime you launch the game MapperFeed will download any new releases from mappers on your favorites list.

# Config
MapperFeed settings are stored in the modprefs.ini which you can find in the UserData folder inside your Beat Saber install directory. The following config options are available:

| Option                     | Description                                                                                                                  |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **AutoDownloadSongs** | Whether or not MapperFeed should automatically download any new songs it finds, or just add them to the MapperFeed playlist. |
| **BeastSaberUsername**| Your username from BeastSaber (https://bsaber.com), this config option is optional. Only enter this if you want to automatically download songs posted to your followings/bookmarks feed on BeastSaber |
