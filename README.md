# MapperFeed v1.0.0
This mod automatically downloads songs from your favorite mappers whenever you launch Beat Saber. If you're lazy like me, this mod is probably for you!

# Getting Started
Create a file called FavoriteMappers.ini in the UserData folder inside your beat saber directory (this file will be created for you automatically when you launch the game, so don't worry if you skipped this step!)

Next, all you have to do is enter your favorite mappers BeatSaver usernames (one mapper per line) in FavoriteMappers.ini.

That's it! Everytime you launch the game MapperFeed will download any new releases from mappers on your favorites list.
